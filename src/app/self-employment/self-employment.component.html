    <p>Since 2016 I have been building up a portfolio of products and tools, including:</p>
    <div class="project">
        <h3>TypeSharp</h3>
        <p>TypeSharp (<a target="_blank" href="https://app.typesharp.co">app.typesharp.co</a>) is a C# to TypeScript
            converter. Although it
            has an API, for demonstration purposes it has been wrapped up into an Angular application. You can import
            and
            export workspaces, all cached in the browser.</p>

        <h3>IQL (will soon be open-sourced)</h3>
        <p>IQL is an ORM built in C#, converted to TypeScript (and ultimately JavaScript) via TypeSharp. This means the
            same
            code can run in .NET, Node, the browser and even phones via tools like NativeScript, React Native, Xamarin,
            Cordova etc.</p>
        <p>It can map to any data endpoint (custom providers can be written) and enables Entity Framework style querying
            from TypeScript/JavaScript.</p>
        <pre><code [highlight]="code"></code></pre>
        <p>IQL supports offline data synchronisation and is provided out-of-the-box with an OData provider.</p>
        <p>IQL was built heavily with TDD and has around 600 unit tests. The tests also convert to TypeScript and run in
            Mocha.</p>

        <h3>DocNet (will soon be open-sourced)</h3>
