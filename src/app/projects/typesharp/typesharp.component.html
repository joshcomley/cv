<h3>TypeSharp</h3>
<p>TypeSharp is a C# to TypeScript
  converter. Although it
  has an API, for demonstration purposes it has been wrapped up into an Angular application. You can
  import
  and
  export workspaces, all cached in the browser.</p>
<p>See <a target="_blank" href="https://app.typesharp.co">app.typesharp.co</a> for demo (very early alpha)
